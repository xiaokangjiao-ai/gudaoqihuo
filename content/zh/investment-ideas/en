# Futures Trading System: 3 Core Rules for Crude Oil/Gold Profit
Many traders lose money in futures, gold, crude oil, or forex because they trade based on intuition— the core problem is lacking a replicable trading system.

This futures trend trading system works for crude oil, gold, and can also be applied to stocks, forex, and indices. Beginners can significantly reduce loss risk after mastering it.

## Rule 1: Only Trade "Clear Trends"
Price movements in futures/gold/crude oil are either "trend" or "range-bound"— the system only targets trend markets:
1. Use the 20-day moving average to judge trend: Price above MA20 = uptrend (only go long); Price below MA20 = downtrend (only go short);
2. Avoid range-bound markets: If price fluctuates within 5% of MA20, stay out of the market;
3. Case Study: In November 2025, crude oil futures broke above MA20— going long with the system brought a 12% profit.

## Rule 2: Strict Stop-Loss (Protect Your Capital)
Stop-loss is the "lifeline" of the trading system (for futures, gold, or forex):
1. Stop-loss level = entry price ± 1% of total capital (e.g., $100 loss for $10,000 capital);
2. Special note for crude oil/gold: Widen stop-loss to 1.5% (never exceed 2%) during high volatility;
3. Common Mistake: Traders let 1% losses expand to 10% by refusing to stop-loss— this violates the system’s core.

## Rule 3: Add Positions on Profit (Amplify Gains)
Add positions when futures/crude oil/gold positions are profitable by 3%:
1. First add: 3% profit → add 1/2 of the initial position;
2. Second add: 6% profit → add 1/4 of the initial position;
3. Never exceed 20% of total capital to avoid overexposure.
